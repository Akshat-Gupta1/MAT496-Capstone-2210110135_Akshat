**Module-3**

**Video-1: Playground**
In the first video, I explored the Playground. The Playground in LangSmith is used for prompt engineering. We can add our own datasets for reference, change the model being used and adjust repetitions to get better results.

I used the dataset I made for the last assignment to see how the model gives different responses. Then I tried changing the system message to make the model reply in another language and it actually worked.

Overall, this video gave me a simple introduction to the Playground. It felt easy to use and helped me understand how small changes in prompts or settings can change the output.
